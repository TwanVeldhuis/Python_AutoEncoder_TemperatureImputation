# Enhancing Data Imputation in Weather IoT Sensor Networks

## Overview
This repository contains research on the application of generative AI, specifically autoencoders, to improve data imputation in IoT sensor networks for meteorological data. The project focuses on addressing the challenge of missing temperature data across Quito’s districts by leveraging the power of denoising autoencoders compared to traditional imputation methods.

## Research Abstract
Weather data collection via IoT sensor networks significantly impacts various sectors, but these networks often suffer from data gaps due to sensor failures and connectivity disruptions. This research aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of historical weather data imputation using autoencoders, contributing to improved decision-making and urban resilience against climate impacts.
